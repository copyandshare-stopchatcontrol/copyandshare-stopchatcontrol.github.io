ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL RULE - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS** ðŸš¨

**BEFORE editing any files, you MUST Read at least 3 files**  
that will help you to understand how to make a coherent and consistency.

This is **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. Do not skip this step under any circumstances.
Reading existing files ensures:
- Code consistency with project patterns
- Proper understanding of conventions
- Following established architecture
- Avoiding breaking changes

**Steps to follow:**
1. Read at least 3 relevant existing files first
2. Understand the patterns and conventions
3. Only then proceed with creating/editing files
